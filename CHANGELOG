# Version 0.7.2
## Misc
* Update Python version support window

# Version 0.7.1
## Misc
* Fix readme sample
* Update Pipfile.lock

# Version 0.7
## Bugfixes
* WG-65726 Unreal Hang due to Waapi Call through Python (UE5.1)

## Misc
* Added `Python 3.11` to the tested runtimes
* Added `run-tests.py` to make it easier to run the test suite

## Behavior
With WG-65726, `enable_debug_log` now assigns the `DEBUG` logging level to the global logging config.

# Version 0.6
## Bugfixes
* WG-54691 Message payloads size is exceeded when using ak.wwise.core.audio.import with 100+ files
* WG-54781 Users can't guaranty order of publish events

## Behavior
With WG-54781, a new argument was added to WaapiClient's constructor to specify an execution strategy for event
handler callbacks. Three strategies are bundled with the `waapi` module, with `PerCallbackThreadExecutor` acting
identically to version 0.5 and `SequentialThreadExecutor` acting as the new default.

* SequentialThreadExecutor (default): A single thread processes callbacks sequential, in order of reception
* PerCallbackThreadExecutor (old default): A new thread runs each callback, in the order they are scheduled
* AsyncioLoopExecutor: Processes the callback on the main asyncio loop (does not support calls to WaapiClient instances)

It is also easy for users to specify a custom strategy by implementing the `CallbackExecutor` interface.

## Misc
* WG-54779 Update pipfile.lock (Closes #7, Closes #9)

# Version 0.5
## Bugfixes
* WG-51774 Cannot use ak.wwise.waapi.getSchema because the uri keyword is used in WaapiClient.call (Closes #5)

# Version 0.4
## Bugfixes
* WG-47527 Multiple calls to disconnect cause hang
* WG-44991 Add support for subprocesses (Closes #1)
* Added check for None decoupler, otherwise null dereferencing when connection failed

## Misc
